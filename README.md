## Book Reading List

Basic python book reading list application. For practicing teamwork and GitHub collaboration. 

The purpose of this app is to create and manage a list of books that the user wishes to read, and books that the user has read. And now I'm adding more comments because I want to practice branching and pull requests.

Uses SQLite3 database to store data. 

Requires Python 3.7.
