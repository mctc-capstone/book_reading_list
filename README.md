## Book Reading List

This program is a basic Python book reading list application which allows users to store a collection of books.
The program first asks the user to make a selection from a menu. From the menu the user can add a book and also search
for a book that's already been added. This program also allows the user to keep track of whether or not they have read
the book, and can display read books, unread books, or both. The user can also delete a book from the database. The user can change the read status of each book. There is also a menu option that displays how many books are currently stored in the database. 

Uses SQLite3 database to store data. 

Requires at least Python 3.7.
