The database file will be stored in the database directory, so we'd like the database directory to exist in the project.  

Git ignores empty directories, and won't add them to the project repository. 

This file is here so there's something in the database directory, so git will include the database directory in the repository. 

This file doesn't do anything else for the project, it's not required to make the project work.
